if working from more than one machine, if sharing work, if worried that my machine isn't reliable   

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

The remote ones might not be of interest. Might not be right. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Fork is when you take a copy of someone else's repository, and make it your own, leaving theirs behind forever. 
Clone is when you make an exact copy of a repository, but in a different place. 
Branch is when you make a copy of a repository with the intention of being able to make changes that don't immediately affect the master but could eventually be merged with it if you wanted. 
    

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
